                    What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)
                    <p class="ans">Innumerable operations exist around us which requires the same task to occur in a loop which includes the endless process of exploration. The motivation for the process of iteration, recursion and backtracking has been inspired from nature. The growth of trees which is a very easy example for recursion in which branch split in smaller branches. Change of seasons which is an easy example of iterations. Backtracking is evident in the behaviour of ants searching for food. They explore multiple path from their colony to various food sources. If a path proves unfruitful they backtrack and attempt alternate routes until they find their routes.</li>
                <li>
                    What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth.
                    <p class="ans">2.	Time efficiency can be defined as the time taken by the algorithm to execute where as space efficiency can be defined as the extra space occupied by the algorithm. These are the two critical parameters that should be taken into consideration as it showcases how well an algorithm utilizes time and memory resources. We aim at having algorithms that works on large amounts of data without taking more time and memory.
                        The different class of problem can be represented in form of graph as follows:
                                               
                        <br> O(1): constant order of growth 
                        <br> O(n): linear order of growth 
                        <br> O(log n): logarithmic order of growth 
                        <br> O(nlogn): Runtime increases more than linear but less than quadratic with input size.
                        <br> O(n2): Runtime increases quadratically.
                        <br> O(n3): Runtime increases cubic.
                        <br> O(2^n): The runtime grows exponentially.
                        <br> O(n!): The runtime grows extremely fast.

                    Take away from different design principles from chapter 2?
                <p class="ans">3.	The design techniques overall suggests that how complex problems can be solved by logically dividing into sub problems ensuring efficient execution using minimum resource. Design techniques like decomposition, abstraction simplify problems. Backtracking helps in exploring various solutions for a problem. Techniques like edge relaxation, Kleene closure and shortest path trees can be together categorized in determining the shortest path. Pruning used in N-queens problems helps in easy discard of solutions which cannot yield the expected result. Parental dominance, the principle adopted by heap, helps in maintaining order and improve efficiency. DFS and BFS which follow the principle of brave and cautious travel help us in navigation through a graph.

                    The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)
                    <p class="ans">From the family of data structures, a hierarchical data structure, trees is used for better organization, insertion and retrieval of data. 
                        Binary search tree efficiently stores sorted data.
                        2-3 tree consists of parent node with 2 or 3 children. It ensures that all leaves are at same depth.
                        AVL trees also referred as balanced search trees is a self balancing binary search tree which ensures that the height difference of the left and right subtrees of the node is maximum 1. 
                        Red black tree is a self-balancing tree with color properties.
                        Heap, following the principle of parental dominance and helps in easy deletion and maintain data in order which has two types minimum heap and maximum heap.
                        Tries helps in prefix based searches and dictionary implementations.

                    The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.
                    <p class="ans">The importance of array queries arises when the problem frequent updates and manipulation of data especially when the array is large or when repeated queries need to be answered efficiently.<br>Lookup Table: A data structure used to efficiently answer queries about a specific range in dataset. As it follows the principle of precomputing, it pre-computes information like addition, subtraction etc and saves these results which saves time and can be used in further operations.<br>Segment Trees: It divides the array in segments creating a binary tree. It follows the principle of lazy propagation which means its ideal for dynamic datasets that require frequent updates and range queries.<br>Sparse tables: Sparse tables are used in answering range minimum queries. It precomputes answers. Ideal for static datasets.<br>Fenwick trees: Fenwick Trees, also called Binary Indexed Trees (BIT), are data structures that help perform
                        range queries and updates efficiently on arrays. It follows the principle of bit manipulation. Each node holds data about a
                        specific range of elements, making it a quick and practical solution for dynamic array problems.

                    <p class="ans">Trees
                        <br>1.	Trees are hierarchical structure with a single root and no cycles which consists of one parent and many children.
                        <br>2.   A tree can be traversed in 3 methods, pre-order, in-order, post order.
                        <br>3. Applications: File systems to organize data.
                        
                        <br>Graphs
                        <br>1. A collection of nodes and edges with possible cycles. It can have multiple parents. They depict node to node relationship and yields us path.
                        <br>2. A graph can be traversed in 2 ways namely depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS).
                        <br>3. Applications: Network connectivity, web pages connectivity.

                    Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and how they connect to the real world.
                    <p class="ans">Techniques include bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort.
                        <br>	Sorting and searching algorithms are essential for easy organization and retrieval of data.
                        Bubble sort: Every element is compared and is swapped.
                        Selection sort: An improvised version of bubble sort in which the minimum element is swapped.
                        Insertion sort: Motivated from the gamblers problem, which inserts elements based on values in accordance with required shifts.
                        Merge sort: A sorting algorithm following the divide and conquer rule, divides the array recursively and merges to get the final one.
                        Quick sort: An algorithm starting with the selection of pivot and partitioning the array in sub arrays and rearranging the elements less than or greater the pivot.
                        Linear and binary search algorithms are useful for locating a specific item in the set of data. 
                        Binary search algorithm outshines as it is used to find element in an already sorted array while dividing the search interval in half recursively which yields improved time efficiency over linear search.
                         In real world scenarios, all of these algorithms helps in database management and e-commerce platforms like sorting products based on preferences and searching a product based on a particular brand.

                <li>
                    Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths.
                    <p class="ans">	Graph algorithms includes two fundamental applications, spanning trees and shortest paths, which are important as they help in network connectivity and optimization. 
                        Spanning tree algorithms like Kruskal’s, Prim’s help in optimizing a network with minimum edges and reducing the overall cost in scenarios where efficiency is an important parameter. It is used in pipelining and cable connections of electrical wires.
                        Shortest path algorithm like Dijakstra’s, Warshall’s, Floyd’s are useful for exploring the most efficient route existing between 2 nodes. It is used in GPS system, routing etc. collectively spanning trees and shortest path trees provide affordable and efficient solution for reducing cost and yield better performance.

                    Discuss the different studied algorithm design techniques.
                    <p class="ans">The design techniques includes the following:
                        1.	Backtracking: Exploring all possible solutions and discarding the solution which does not satisfy result is the technique obeyed by backtracking. 
                        It can be used in N-queens problems and solving of a sudoku.
                        2.	Divide and conquer: In which one problem is subsequently divided into its subsequent sub-problems and finally merged to get the end result.
                        The technique is obeyed by merge sort and quick sort algorithms.
                        3.	Brute force string search technique: It involves an exhaustive trial and error approach is used to find final solution. Algorithms like Boyer- Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt etc follow this technique.
                        
                        4.	Greedy techniques: In order to determine the shortest path, between two nodes in a weighted graph this technique can be optimized. This technique is followed by dijakstra’s algorithm, prim’s algorithm etc.
