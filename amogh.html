                <li>
                    What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)
                    <p class="ans">We can observe many different problems in nature that we can relate to iterations and backtracking. One such example would be the change in seasons, which happens in a cycle throughout the year, which we can relate to an iteration. The growth of cabbage leaves, forming layers, can be related to recursion, and the ants exploring their whole territory and returning back to their home can be related to backtracking. There are various other instances in nature that can be related to iterations, recursion, and backtracking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth.
                    <p class="ans">Space Complexity: Is the extra space taken by an algorithm to execute. Time complexity: Time taken by an algorithm to execute is called time complexity. Space and time complexity are important for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms. They help programmers understand how an algorithm performs and whether it is suitable for specific applications. The orders of growth of an algorithm describe how time or space requirements grow as the input size increases.
                        <br> O(1) -> constant order of growth <br> O(n) -> linear order of growth <br> O(log n) -> logarithmic order of growth
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take away from different design principles from chapter 2?
                    <p class="ans">After studying different algorithms, the key ideas started to make sense. Learning how AVL trees and Red-Black trees maintain balance highlighted the importance of structures in data and efficient operations. Comparing brave and cautious travel to DFS and BFS in graph traversal showed how different strategies can solve problems effectively. Finally, understanding how various sorting algorithms work, such as dividing and merging or swapping elements, helped to understand their logic. In all, these concepts have provided a solid foundation for the principles of algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)
                    <p class="ans">Tree data structures help organize hierarchical data efficiently and solve various problems. Binary search trees improve searching by ordering the roots, but they are not balanced. A 2-3 tree is a self-balancing tree designed to keep operations efficient by keeping all leaf nodes at the same level, but this still introduces skewness in the tree. Hence, we moved towards the AVL tree, which was balanced based on a balancing factor and rotations. Further, to reduce the number of rotations, we moved to the Red-Black tree. Heap is a complete binary tree that ensures the heap property. Heaps are good for priority queues. A Trie is a tree data structure primarily used for storing strings. Tries are used for tasks like autocomplete and prefix search.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.
                    <p class="ans">Array queries are necessary for efficiently handling large amounts of data with frequent updates. Lookup tables are good for precomputing and storing results to allow fast retrieval during range queries. Segment trees are versatile structures and useful for efficient updates. An alternative to these is BIT with simpler code for range queries, operating on the principle of isolating the last bit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each.
                    <p class="ans">Trees and graphs are both structures used to organize data, but they differ in many ways. A tree is a hierarchical structure with one root node and no cycles, whereas a graph is a set of nodes connected together by edges, and it can have cycles.
                        <br>Tree traversal:<br> 1. Pre-order<br> 2. In-order<br> 3. Post-order<br><br>
                        Graph traversal:<br> 1. DFS (Depth First Search): Brave Traversal<br> 2. BFS (Breadth First Search): Cautious Traversal<br><br>
                        Trees are used for representing hierarchical data and for searching the shortest path and sorting. Graphs are used in applications for finding the shortest path.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and how they connect to the real world.
                    <p class="ans">Sorting and searching algorithms are important for organizing and finding data efficiently, with many real-world uses. Sorting algorithms like quick sort and merge sort arrange data in order, which is helpful in tasks like organizing products for e-commerce websites. Searching algorithms like binary search locate specific items, used in search engines and e-commerce websites.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths.
                    <p class="ans">Graphs are important with respect to spanning trees to calculate MST (Minimum Spanning Tree), which is used to connect all the nodes in the graph with the least cost, making it useful for laying roads and pipelines. Shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, help in finding the quickest or shortest way to travel between nodes, which is useful in GPS navigation apps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discuss the different studied algorithm design techniques.
                    <p class="ans">Different algorithms studied:<br>1. Backtracking: It involves exploring all possible solutions and pruning the ones that do not lead to a solution, learned with the example of the N-queens problem.<br><br>2. Sorting Algorithms: <br> i. Divide and conquer: Quick and Merge Sort<br> ii. Comparison-Based: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort.<br><br> 3.

                <h3>Affordable Clean Energy Solutions</h3>
                <p>In the case of implementing Affordable Clean Energy Solutions, the algorithm for the shortest path can be used to optimize the routes for energy transmission, ensuring the energy reaches consumers in the shortest and most cost-effective way.
                   <ul>

                <h3>Education & Vocational Training Centers</h3>
                <p>To efficiently place Education and Vocational Training Centers so everyone can access them easily, we can use graph traversal algorithms. Let us consider that the localities or towns are the
                     nodes and roads connections with weights as the distance between the travel time.
                    Dijkstra’s algorithm helps calculate the shortest path from one center to all towns, 
                    useful for checking accessibility. Floyd's algorithm helps us finds the shortest paths between all towns, helpful for analyzing overall connectivity.
                    Kruskals algorithm helps us find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to connect nodes at minimum cost.

                        <p>If we already know where to place the centers, we can use Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of locations, including the centers and the people's homes.
                             By applying Floyd-Warshall's algorithm, we can determine the shortest paths for people to reach their nearest centers. <br>

                <h3>E-commerce & Online Marketplaces</h3>
                <p>To successfully implement an e-commerce marketplace, we can use a wide variety of algorithms.
                     For example, binary search can be used to quickly search for products, merge sort can help sort the products, 
                    and recommendation engines can suggest different products to the user.
                   <ul>
                    <li>Binary Search algorithm:
                        <p>Binary Search is a highly efficient algorithm used to find a  value within a sorted array or list. It works 
                            by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, which allows it to search through large datasets much faster than linear search. <br>

                <h3>Telecommunications Services</h3>
                <p>Kruskals algorithm can be used in this case to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
                    We can relate this situation to a graph with the towers for the Telecommunication services as 
                    the nodes and the fibre optics cables used for fast communication as the edges between the nodes 
                    and the cost per unit length of laying the cables as the weight on the edge between each node. Now
                     Kruskals algorithm will help us to find the most efficient route for laying the cables with the least possible cost.
                   <ul>
                    <li>Kruskal’s Algorithm:
                        <p>Kruskal's algorithm is used to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), which connects all nodes in a graph with the least total cost. It’s helpful for efficiently connecting towers, like setting up fiber optics or signal relays, while minimizing expenses. However, it doesn’t focus on maximizing area coverage. Its time complexity is 
                           O(n log n), making it efficient for interconnecting towers. <br>

                <h3>Microfinance or Lending Services</h3>
                <p>A sorting algorithm can be used for this case.Sorting algorithms can be used to arrange the applicants based on their credit score or the size 
                    of the loan or the urgency of the loan. Overall, sorting is an essential tool for balancing risk, maximizing impact, and improving  
                    efficiency in microfinancing. We can use sorting algorithms like Quick sort and merge sort for this purpose as they are good at handeling large data efficiently.
                   <ul>
                    <li>Quick sort:
                        <p>Quick Sort is an efficient comparison based sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array or list. Quick sort is useful in this

                            As the city aims to become a self-sufficient, sustainable, and developed city, 
                            educational institutions play an important role in this process. For this, it is 
                            important to set up educational institutions across the entire city in such a way 
                            that they are accessible to all the people.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To achieve this, we will first analyze the total number of eligible students/people 
                            who will access these educational institutions. This can be done using a <b>basic summation algorithm</b>. 
                            The next step is to arrange the areas based on the number of people who will be accessing these institutions,
                             which can be done using sorting algorithms such as <b>quick sort and merge sort</b>.

                        </li>
                        <li>Once we have sorted the areas based on population, we can finalize the locations and sizes of these institutions.
                             The size of an institution will depend on the number of people attending it. Hence, larger institutions will be set 
                             up in more populated areas based on the sorted list.
                        </li>
                        <li>The next step is to strategically select the locations of the institutions to ensure that they do not cause any harm to
                             the environment in the process of building it. After selecting the locations for the educational institutions, the next 
                             task is to set up a bus or pickup/drop service for all the students attending these institutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>For this, we need to design an efficient and cost-saving route for the buses to drop each student at their home. 
                            This can be done using an <b>all-pairs shortest path algorithm like Floyd's algorithm.</b> We can consider the institution
                             and the homes of each student as the nodes, and the roads connecting these areas as the edges, with weights as the travel cost.
                              By applying <b>Floyd's algorithm</b> to this graph representation, we can design the most efficient route for dropping off each student.
                        </li>
                        <li>Now that we have set up institutions in strategic locations accessible to all, it is important for these institutions to function in an 
                            organized manner to ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience. To achieve this, we need to keep a record of each student. This can be done
                             using an <b>array of structures</b> to store student information such as name, roll number, contact details, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>For the admission process, we can use a <b>queue data structure</b> to provide admission on a first-come, first-served basis. Alternatively, we can 
                            sort the students based on their marks using a <b>sorting technique</b> and then provide admission based on the marks obtained by each student.

                <p>Micro-financing and lending services play an important role in the development of a city. They help people with low incomes access financial resources for housing improvements or purchases. This leads to the overall development of infrastructure in the city.

                    To implement this, we first need to store all the customer data,
                     for which we can use an <b>array of structures.</b> To ensure the correct
                      order of loan distribution, we can use <b>priority queues based on heaps,</b> 
                       distributing loans based on the urgency of the requirement. Another important
                        factor to consider is the credit scores, which determine whether loans are approved.
                         This can be done using <b>sorting algorithms</b> to sort the list based on credit scores.Further <b>hashing</b> can be used to store sensitive customer data securely.

                            E-commerce and online marketplaces play an important role 
                            in boosting the economy of a city. They also make the lives of 
                            people easier by providing doorstep deliveries. There are various
                             algorithms that can be used to implement an online e-commerce 
                             marketplace. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Firstly, we can use <b>binary search</b> to search for products from a list of different products. We can also use tries for the autocomplete feature during typing in the search bar.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We can use <b>string matching algorithms like KMP and Rabin-Karp</b> to 
                            search for names of the products efficiently in the database. The 
                            next thing is that we can use <b>sorting algorithms</b> to sort the products
                             based on prices, ratings, and popularity. We can use <b>recommendation
                                engines</b> to recommend products to users based on their previous 
                              purchases or viewed products. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lastly, at the time of delivery, we can use shortest path algorithms like 
                            <b>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</b> to optimize delivery routes. This can be done by
                             considering the storage hub as the source node where all the products 
                             have been collected from different parts of the country and are ready
                              to be set out for delivery. The other nodes are the houses of the 
                              customers to whom the products need to be delivered. The routes
                               joining them are the edges, with weights as the cost of travel. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Now, by using <b>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</b>, we find the most efficient route to 
                            deliver the products to the customers' houses.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Arrays and lists</b> can be used for storing product lists, order details, user carts, or customer feedback.

                        </li>
                        <li><b>Stack </b>can be used to keep track of undo actions in the shopping cart and for implementing backtracking </li>
                        <li><b>Union-Find </b> can be used for managing user groups or authentication-related tasks.</li>
