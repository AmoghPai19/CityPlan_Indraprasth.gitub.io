            <h3>Collab 1: Amogh & Bhoomika </h3>
            <p>While working on our separate cases, we (Bhoomika and Amogh) discovered a strong 
                linkage between our topics. The Cultural and Entertainment Districts and the Education
                 & Vocational Training Centers can collaborate effectively, especially by partnering with 
                 schools and organizations to ensure knowledge transfer to younger generations. By doing so,
                  we can provide ample learning opportunities alongside entertainment, offering students hands-on 
                  experiences in various fields. This collaboration would not only benefit the future of students but 
                  also support the growth and management of the Entertainment Districts, creating a mutually beneficial 
                  environment.We were able to figure out more links in our respective business cases and hence decided to collaborate
                to create a seamless experience for the people living in our city

            <h3>Collab 2: Ramya, Saanvi and Amogh </h3>
            <p>The ecommerce buisness created by Amogh can be linked with the mulberry silk production industry and cotton industry proposed by Saanvi and Ramya respectively. For mulberry silk, online shopping platforms enable silk producers to connect directly with customers globally. This direct access allows small-scale silk farms and artisans to increase their profits by eliminating middlemen. It also provides an opportunity
                for these producers to showcase their unique, high-quality silk products to a wider audience, fostering appreciation for their craftsmanship.<br>
              Similarly, the cotton industry has experienced a transformation through eCommerce. Farmers and manufacturers can now sell their cotton textiles directly to consumers via online platforms. This direct-to-consumer approach not only expands their market reach but also promotes sustainable practices by reducing the need for intermediaries. The transparency and ease of online transactions have made it possible for 
                consumers to support ethical and sustainable cotton production, which in turn benefits the environment and local communities.
