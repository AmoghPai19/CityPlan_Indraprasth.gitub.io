                <li>
                    What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)
                    <p class="ans">As discussed in the beginning of DAA, nature is something, we can provide real world problem solutions through nature. <br>Nature is all about patterns and Structures. 

                        Repeated cycles of seasons- spring, summer, rainy, winter are iterative processes in nature.  They will repeat until some other climatic changes hit. <br>
                        
                        We saw patterns on the millipede and it follows recursion.
                        
                        Backtracking in real world nature, when the rabbits explore burrow systems. <br> If they don't find their way, they backtrack! <br> </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth.
                    <p class="ans">The extra space taken by the algorithm is the space efficiency. Whereas, the time taken by the algorithm is time efficiency.

                        They are important in terms of costs, processing time and depends upon the memory too.
                        
                        <br> O(1) -> constant order of growth <br> O(n) -> linear order of growth <br> O(log n) -> logarithmic order of growth
                    </p>
                </li>
                      <img width="400" height="300" src="orders_of_growth_image.jpg" alt="orders of growth graph image">

                <li>
                    Take away from different design principles from chapter 2?
                    <p class="ans">After analyzing different algorithms, everything made sense with principles.

                        Brave and cautious travel relates us to a BFS and DFS graph traversals.
                        Prefixes and suffixes play important roles in the substring algorithm (Boyer Moore and KMP)
                        
                        Balancing and Rotations is necessary in AVL and black trees. We need all these principles to understand algorithms in a design approach manner!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)
                    <p class="ans">The most efficient way to take down hierarchical data is using binary tree.
                        Binary search trees can create skewed trees and in order to balance it, we moved to the notation of introducing more than one item in a node. Hence, we used AVL trees ( to rotate as it still introduced skewness)
                        Red black trees is more easier to implement than AVL. Trie is used to spell check, and dictionary. Heap can be created based on different requirements and we heapify.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.
                    <p class="ans"> Websites like Amazon allow customers to filter products based on price ranges. 
                        Shoppers can specify a minimum and maximum price to quickly find items that fit their budget. <br>
                       <br> Financial trading platforms use range queries to allow traders to analyze stock performance over specific time periods. <br>
                        <br> BIT with simpler code for range queries, operating on the principle of isolating the last bit.
                        Array queries, look up table precomputes and keep the results. <br> </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each.
                    <p class="ans">  Tree <br>
                        -A connected, acyclic graph with n nodes and n-1 edges. <br>

                       <br> BFS: visit all neighbour nodes before moving. <br>

                <li>
                    Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and how they connect to the real world.
                    <p class="ans">  Sorting algorithms organizes data into a specific order (ascending or descending) <br>

                       <br> 1. Bubble Sort: repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps in order. <br>
                        
                        2. Insertion Sort: We Insertion, elements in correct positions. <br>
                        
                        3. Selection Sort: Selects the smallest or largest element from unsorted portion and places in sorted portion. <br>
                        
                        4. Merge sort: divides the arrays into halves and merge them. <br>
                        
                        5. Quick sort: picks a "pivot", partitions the array around it. <br>
                        
                       Applications:
                        Database Management: Sorting records for efficient querying and indexing. 
                        
                        E-commerce: Displaying products based on price, rating. <br>
                        
                       <br> Searching Algorithm: locate a specific element in a data structure.
                        This includes, linear and binary searches, graph- based Searches. 
                        
                       <br> Applications:
                        Searching for files in hierarchical directories, Hash- based searches. <br> </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths.
                    <p class="ans">Spanning trees connect all vertices with minimal total edge weight, minimizing total network cost.
                        Whereas, shortest path find the minimal path weight between specific vertices minimizing travel or traversal cost.
                        
                       <br> Real world application:
                        Spanning trees: Building utility networks like water or gas pipelines <br>

                        -Divide and conquer: Quick sort and Merge sort <br>
                        
                        -Shortest path: Floyd's, Dijkstra's.
                        Here we find the shortest paths possible with the provided weights using or implementing a cost matrix. <br>

                <p> In this particular business case, we can apply KRUSKAL's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST).
                    Considering, the example of ZEPTO delivery services, our city would implement the same but using this algorithm.
                    FASTER the service, HAPPIER the customer is the goal (successful business implementation too). <br>
                    Providing the MST to the delivery man can be done using the live location and the algorithm would provide us the shortest path with less costs(We all know petrol is costly) and less time, directly supporting the business growth!

                             The algorithm would be used in such a way that the locations of the customers are already known and we would solve it like the INVITATION problem done in the classroom. <br>

                    Kruskal's algorithm is used to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), which can help optimize the layout of roads, electrical grids, or water supply systems.
                    - Example: Ensuring all areas are connected with minimal construction cost.
                     Kruskals algorithm will help us to find the most efficient route for laying the pipelines for water management system or the electrical grids with the least possible cost.

                    Cultural programs can use QUICK SORT technique to sort the audience and their purchased tickets accordingly.
                    Just like the PVR or any concert we all are been too, THE RECLINER, THE GOLD, THE SILVER and maybe many more.
                    The people need to be seated according to the seat and hence, sorting them based on their ticket number is the most efficient way to solve this particular problem.
